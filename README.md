# TradingView Technical Signals

*This is not a runnable script.*

I extracted the Javascript functions TradingView uses to compute technical signals, returning `n.BUY`, `n.SELL` or `n.NEUTRAL`.

You can use those to recreate TradingView Technical Signals in your application / bot with any data source of your choice.
You still have to use an external library to compute technical indicators.
